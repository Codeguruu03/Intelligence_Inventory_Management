REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE 🏭
================================================================================

Scenario: Construction Material Warehouse (India)

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WITHOUT THESE FEATURES:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Owner: "My inventory is managed in Excel. I can see stock levels 
but don't know:
  • Who changed prices last week?
  • Why did we buy 1000 bags of cement and sell only 100?
  • Are we paying suppliers fairly?
  • How do I file GST returns?
  • Did we sell expired items?
  • What will sell next month?"

Result: Lost profit, legal risk, disorganization

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WITH THESE FEATURES:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Owner: "My system shows me:
  ✓ Audit shows Manager X raised cement price by 10% on Dec 20
  ✓ Forecasting says demand peaks in Jan-Feb, so buy now
  ✓ Supplier ratings show Vendor A is 5% cheaper, 99% on-time
  ✓ GST reports generated automatically - ready for filing
